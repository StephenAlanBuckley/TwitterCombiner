    Fill in your secret keys from Twitter here.

    If you don't know your secrets off the top of your head  and need to look them up/get them, here's how. (If you have your oauth token memorized, I'm sorry, but you are a robot for sure.)

    We're going to Twitter's App center, specifically your account page. If you're not already logged in, log in at https://apps.twitter.com/

    Once you're logged in, either click on the app you want to use Twitter Combiner in, or create it. Afterwards you should be on https://apps.twitter.com/app/<your_app_id>

    Click on Keys and Access Tokens in the menu of the page.

    Take your consumer_key and consumer_secret from this page.

    Below, there will be your access tokens. If you don't already have these, create them now.

    Plug those in before their corresponding commas below and you're ready to go!
